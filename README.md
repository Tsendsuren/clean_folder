# Auto clean folder
This program will automatically sort files into folders based on their extensions.

As time passes, folders such as downloads become clogged with a variety of documents with various file extensions. Organizing them takes time and is tedious. However, a piece of code can be used to automatically organize the files. This can be accomplished in a variety of ways. Here's how I came up with my own version.

The code will look for file extensions in a folder and create a new folder named with the file extension. The files will be sorted and moved to the appropriate new folder.

Enjoy!
